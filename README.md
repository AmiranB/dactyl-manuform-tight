# Compactyl - A Compact Dactyl ManuForm Keyboard

This is a fork of [the okke fork](https://github.com/okke-formsma/dactyl-manuform-tight) of the [l4u fork](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard)of the [tshort fork](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard) of the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard), a parameterized, split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard.

## Features
- Hotswap north facing switch plates
- Increase pinky stagger
- Adjusted column spacing for better clearance
- Continuous (vs. recessed) bottom plate with filleted holes
- Exoskeleton top case design
- Updated USB holder
- Rendered both 4x6 and 5x6 versions with bottom plate
- (orig. Tightyl) As small around the keys as possible
- (orig. Tightyl) Smoother transition between thumb and fingers (less facets)
- (orig. Tightyl) Thicker walls in steep regions where walls were too thin

## Generate OpenSCAD and STL models

* Run `lein repl`
* In the repl run `(load-file "src/dactyl_keyboard/dactyl.clj")`
* This will regenerate the `things/*.scad` files
* Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
* Make changes to design, repeat `load-file`, OpenSCAD will watch for changes and rerender.
* When done, use OpenSCAD to render, then export model STL files which can be printed by 3d printer slicing software.


## Tips

* When trying things out, 10 seconds of rendering time in OpenSCAD is really annoying. Load one of the test outputs with commented out parts that you don't use.
* If you're not sure what things are generted by a piece of code (see examples in dactyl.clj, color them in using something like
`(->> SOMETHING_HERE (color RED))`
